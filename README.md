# red7_GUI  WORK ON PROGRESS
red7 card game clone with GUI with arcade library

v34 gives a little sort of player 0 palette, but not perfect, like a kind of swaping

v36 dirty fix for sorting player 0 palette, was strange for droping last card from hand to palette.

v39 you can drop card on canvas , but logical part does not take it in account yet

Project halted because of too strong coupling between graphic part and logical part ; built too fast upon Solitaire documentation example which design does not mix well with my starting game Red7 ; should work from start but lack motivation today, later ++
